### Issue Summary

**Duration:**  
- Start: September 1, 2024, 10:30 AM (UTC)  
- End: September 1, 2024, 12:45 PM (UTC)

**Impact:**  
For 2 hours and 15 minutes, our e-commerce platform took an unscheduled coffee break, leaving 85% of our users either twiddling their thumbs as pages loaded at the speed of a snail or unable to complete their transactions. During this time, successful transactions plummeted by 90%, leading to lost revenue and some very unhappy customers who now think our site runs on dial-up.

**Root Cause:**  
A memory leak in our payment processing microservice was the culprit. Think of it as a hole in a bucket that gets worse every time you add more water. In this case, the water was user inputs that weren’t properly sanitized, causing the service to eventually throw in the towel and crash.

### Timeline

- **10:35 AM:** Monitoring tools started shouting at us with alerts about a nosedive in transaction completions.
- **10:40 AM:** I put on my detective hat and suspected the database was guilty due to slow queries.
- **11:00 AM:** Called in the database team, who applied their magic, but the site still didn’t wake up.
- **11:15 AM:** Customer complaints flooded in faster than we could say “Uh-oh,” so I called in the SRE team.
- **11:30 AM:** Spotted our payment processing microservice hoarding memory like a squirrel preparing for winter.
- **11:50 AM:** Took a wrong turn, suspecting an external API was misbehaving. Spoiler: It wasn’t.
- **12:00 PM:** Handed the case over to the development team, the true detectives in this story.
- **12:20 PM:** They found the memory leak caused by unsanitized inputs—our villain revealed!
- **12:30 PM:** Applied a quick band-aid fix, and the service slowly started to get back on its feet.
- **12:45 PM:** Full service was restored, and everyone breathed a sigh of relief.

### Root Cause and Resolution

**Root Cause:**  
Imagine feeding a machine the wrong type of fuel. In our case, the fuel was user inputs that weren’t properly filtered, and the machine was our payment processing microservice. These unfiltered inputs caused memory usage to skyrocket until the service finally waved a white flag and stopped working altogether, much like an overloaded computer that freezes when you open too many tabs.

**Resolution:**  
After identifying the issue, our dev team quickly threw in a hotfix that sanitized the user inputs before they could wreak havoc. This stopped the memory leak and allowed the microservice to recover. Later that day, we rolled out a permanent fix after carefully refactoring the code to handle this edge case more gracefully, ensuring that our platform won’t pull another vanishing act anytime soon.

### Corrective and Preventative Measures

**Improvements:**  
- Sanitize inputs like they’re going through airport security—no exceptions.
- Monitor memory usage like a hawk, ready to swoop down at the first sign of trouble.
- Hold a team-wide “How to Spot a Memory Leak” workshop, complete with snacks and bad jokes.

**Tasks:**
1. **Patch payment processing microservice:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization.
2. **Add memory monitoring:** Upgrade our dashboards with real-time memory usage alerts for all critical microservices.
3. **Refactor code:** Perform a thorough code review of the payment processing microservice to eliminate potential weak spots.
4. **Incident response review:** Revise our incident response playbook to ensure faster escalation to the right experts.
5. **Training:** Host a fun, interactive training session on detecting and fixing memory-related issues—maybe with a quiz at the end for bragging rights.
