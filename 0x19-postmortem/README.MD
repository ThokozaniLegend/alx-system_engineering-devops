### Issue Summary

**Duration:**  
- Start: September 1, 2024, 10:30 AM (UTC)
- End: September 1, 2024, 12:45 PM (UTC)

**Impact:**  
Our main e-commerce platform faced a significant outage that affected approximately 85% of our users. They experienced either extremely slow page load times or were entirely unable to complete their transactions. During the outage, successful transactions dropped by 90%, causing a substantial revenue loss and triggering a wave of customer complaints.

**Root Cause:**  
The root cause was traced to an unexpected memory leak in our payment processing microservice. This issue was triggered by a specific combination of user inputs that weren’t properly sanitized before being processed, leading the service to become unresponsive.

### Timeline

- **10:35 AM:** Our automated monitoring tools flagged a sharp decline in successful transactions.
- **10:40 AM:** I began investigating and initially suspected a database performance issue due to slow queries.
- **11:00 AM:** I notified the database team, who started optimizing queries, but we saw no improvement.
- **11:15 AM:** With customer complaints pouring in, I escalated the issue to the SRE team.
- **11:30 AM:** We noticed unusually high memory usage in the payment processing microservice during further investigation.
- **11:50 AM:** We briefly suspected an external API problem, but this turned out to be a red herring.
- **12:00 PM:** I escalated the issue to the development team responsible for the payment microservice.
- **12:20 PM:** The dev team identified the memory leak caused by unsanitized inputs.
- **12:30 PM:** We deployed a temporary fix, and the service began to recover.
- **12:45 PM:** Full service was restored, and monitoring confirmed stability.

### Root Cause and Resolution

**Root Cause:**  
The memory leak was caused by a specific combination of user inputs that our payment processing microservice couldn’t handle correctly. These inputs were not sanitized before processing, leading to a situation where memory usage spiked with each new request. Over time, this caused the microservice to slow down and eventually become unresponsive, impacting the entire platform as requests backed up.

**Resolution:**  
After identifying the issue, our development team quickly implemented a hotfix to sanitize the user inputs before they reached the vulnerable part of the code. This stopped the memory leak, allowing the microservice to recover. We then deployed a more permanent fix later in the day, which involved refactoring the code to handle this edge case more robustly after conducting thorough testing.

### Corrective and Preventative Measures

**Improvements:**  
- Strengthen input validation and sanitization processes across all services.
- Enhance monitoring to detect memory leaks and unusual memory usage patterns earlier.
- Increase training and awareness around edge cases and how to handle them in code.

**Tasks:**
1. **Patch payment processing microservice:** Implement stronger input validation and sanitization.
2. **Add memory monitoring:** Integrate detailed memory usage monitoring into our existing dashboards for all critical microservices.
3. **Refactor code:** Conduct a full review of the payment processing microservice to identify and fix potential vulnerabilities.
4. **Incident response review:** Update our incident response protocols to ensure quicker escalation to relevant development teams.
5. **Training:** Conduct a team-wide training session on detecting and resolving memory-related issues.
